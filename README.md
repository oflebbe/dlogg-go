# dlogg-go

Support for the Reading logs from the UVR1611 and UVR61-3 Control Units 
for thermal solar engines.

Tested with the USB Datalogger on an UVR1611 in 1DL mode.

The protocol is reengineered ot of the source code of the https://github.com/fb/dlogg-linux repository.
Redone because it is too inflexible to be used as an backend for further processing.

The project should work on any operating system.

Acknowledgement to H. RÃ¶mer for creating and maintaing dlogg-linux.
